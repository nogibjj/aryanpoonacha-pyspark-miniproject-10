## PySpark Lab
Miniproject 10 for IDS 706, Fall 2023.

Uses the massive exoplanets database from NASA: https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/TblView/nph-tblView?app=ExoTbls&config=PS 

Loads the data from the large csv file, loads and tranforms it, and then queries it using PySpark to select the top 10 planets with the longest orbital periods and their corresponding host names and print the result of the query.
